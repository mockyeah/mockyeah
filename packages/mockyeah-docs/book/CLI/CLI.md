# CLI

mockyeah-cli provides a simple command line interface for recording and playing suites to integrate with during development.

## Getting started

1. Install mockyeah-cli

```shell
$ npm install -g mockyeah-cli
```

or

```
$ yarn global add mockyeah-cli
```

2. Configure a service call to proxy through mockyeah

To do so prepend `http://localhost:4001/` to the beginning of a service end-point in your project like so:

```
http://localhost:4001/http://example.com/your/service/url
```

We agree the above URL looks pretty nutty, but rest assured all other known approaches add unnecessary complexity.

3. Initiate a mockyeah suite recording

```shell
$ mockyeah record my-first-suite
```

4. Invoke the service call you previously configured. You should see mockyeah-cli output.

5. Stop mockyeah-cli by hitting enter on the stop question.

6. Play back the suite

```shell
$ mockyeah play my-first-suite
```

7. Invoke the service call again.

Good work! You've recorded and played back a suite.

## Options

```console
$ mockyeah --help

Usage: mockyeah [options] [command]

  Commands:

    list                list suites

For help with specific commands, you can pass `--help` to them, e.g.:

```console
$ mockyeah record --help

Usage: mockyeah-record [options]

  Options:

    -g, --group, --groups [names]  record with these named groups from configuration (comma-separated and/or repeatable)

## Play

`mockyeah play [options] [suiteNames]`

Play one or more suites, passing comma-separated list of suite names, or else be prompted to pick one.

E.g., comma-separated:

```console
$ mockyeah play some-custom-suite,some-custom-suite-2
```

or space-separated:

```console
$ mockyeah play some-custom-suite some-custom-suite-2
```
