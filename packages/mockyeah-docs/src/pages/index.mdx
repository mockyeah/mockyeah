## What problem does `mockyeah` solve?

`mockyeah` helps decouple HTTP integrations throughout development and testing.

Testing is difficult when you don't have control of your data. Developing service integrations can be a painful process. APIs designs are often influx, incomplete, unstable, or completely unavailable.
`mockyeah` puts you in complete control, enabling you to implement mock HTTP responses with ease to integrate and test with during development. Real mock services means you have control of response payloads, HTTP status codes, response latency, and more.

Does your app have special behavior when a service is slow to respond or a server returns an unexpected status code? No problem! `mockyeah` makes developing for such requirements easy.

## What is `mockyeah`'s purpose?

- To eliminate service side effects, increasing test durability
- To provide dependable integrations
- To isolate application behavior
- To increase developer productivity
- To increase integration testing performance by eliminating network latency

## What makes `mockyeah` unique?

You might be familiar with `nock` - it works great for mocking in
server-side or other Node apps, and in unit tests.
But it's not designed to work with client-side apps, and doesn't
provide an actual server for mocked responses.
`mockyeah` can do all of the above and more, all with the same syntax!

You might also be familiar with `Polly.JS` - like `mockyeah`, it supports both client and server-side mocking.
It's a great tool, but its design seems more oriented around
automatically recording and replaying known requests,
and to initiate recording requires configuration in app source code,
which means rebuilding or redeploying your app just to be able to record.\
`mockyeah` lets you create suites of mocks that you can
opt-in to at will with a cookie. It has a powerful & expressive
request matching API. You can easily create mocks
from scratch or by recording. You can initiate recording
any request on-demand from a CLI once your app is initially
configured once upfront with `mockyeah` - set & forget!
