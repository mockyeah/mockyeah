## What problem does mockyeah solve?

Helps decouple HTTP integrations throughout development and testing.

Testing is difficult when you don't have control of your data. Developing service integrations can be a painful process. APIs designs are often influx, incomplete, unstable, or completely unavailable.
mockyeah puts you in complete control, enabling you to implement **real mock web services** with ease to integrate and test with during development. Real mock services means you have control of response payloads, HTTP status codes, response latency, and more.

Have a requirement to implement specific behavior when a service is slow to respond or a server returns an unexpected status code? No problem! mockyeah makes developing for such requirements easy.

## What is mockyeah's purpose?

- To eliminate service side effects, increasing test durability
- To provide dependable integrations
- To isolate application behavior
- To increase developer productivity
- To increase integration testing performance by eliminating network latency
