# Getting Started

First, decide how you want to use `mockyeah`:

- [Mock in my client-side web app.](Getting-Started/Client-Side)

  - For use during development, manual or functional testing.
  - Or try the [DevTools Extension](../WebExtension).

- [Mock in my Node app.](Getting-Started/Node)

  - For use with Node servers, CLIs, etc.

- [Spin up a mock server.](Getting-Started/Server)

  - A language-agnostic HTTP server that can mock or proxy requests.

- [Mock in unit tests.](Getting-Started/Unit-Tests)
  - For test frameworks in Node like Jest, Mocha, etc.
