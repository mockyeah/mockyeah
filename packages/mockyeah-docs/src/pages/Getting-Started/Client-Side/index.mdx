# Getting Started on Client-Side

To integrate `mockyeah` to mock requests within your client-side app,
you can use the [`@mockyeah/fetch`](../../Packages/mockyeah-fetch) package.

This can monkeypatch or be used in place of the native `fetch` API to enable some `mockyeah` features.
This requires `fetch` API support - recommended client-side `fetch` polyfills are `whatwg-fetch` or `isomorhpic-fetch`.

[`@mockyeah/fetch`](../../Packages/mockyeah-fetch) intercepts requests that match any mocks
and responds with mock data, bypassing a network call entirely.
For some use cases, this can have a number of advantages over
the [`@mockyeah/server`](../../Packages/mockyeah-server), including:

- faster responses with no networking round-trip latency
- more deterministic unit tests
- simplified infrastructure for integration in higher environments
- ability to inject code into app during automated functional regression tests
  over the WebDriver protocol, such as with Selenium, etc.

To install:

```shell
$ npm add @mockyeah/fetch
```

Then, to set it up, simply add this code to run once when your app starts:

```js
import 'isomorhpic-fetch';
import Mockyeah from '@mockyeah/fetch';

new Mockyeah();
```

Or to add mocks programmatically:

```js
import 'isomorhpic-fetch';
import Mockyeah from '@mockyeah/fetch';

const mockyeah = new Mockyeah();

mockyeah.mock('https://example.local?ok=yes', {
  json: { fake: 'response' }
});

mockyeah.post(
  {
    url: 'https://example.local?ok=true',
    body: {
      up: 'yes'
    }
  },
  {
    json: () => ({ hello: 'there' })
  }
);

fetch('https://example.local?ok=yes').then(async res => {
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log('data is now { fake: "response" }', data);
});
```

If you want to load [mock suites](../../Suites), fixtures, or files from your local filesystem,
and you've configured your code bundler correctly, you can use:

```js
const mockyeah = new Mockyeah({
  mockSuiteResolver: name => import(`../mockyeah/${name}`),
  fixtureResolver: path => import(`../fixtures/${path}`),
  fileResolver: path => import(`../${path}`)
});
```

For more details, see our page on [@mockyeah/fetch](../../Packages/mockyeah-fetch).

## CLI

You can use our command-line interface to record [suites](../../Suites) with `@mockyeah/fetch` on the client-side.
You just need to ensure you haven't disabled WebSockets in your [client](../../Packages/mockyeah-fetch/Configuration) or [server configuration](../../Packages/mockyeah-server/Configuration) (`noWebSocket`).
See more at [`@mockyeah/cli`](../Packages/mockyeah-cli).
Other CLI commands like play don't yet work with client-side [`@mockyeah/fetch`](../../Packages/mockyeah-fetch), but stay tuned.
