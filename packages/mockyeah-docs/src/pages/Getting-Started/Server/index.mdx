# Getting Started with Server

`mockyeah` can spin up a real server that can mock or proxy requests. It can work in your local or a higher environment.
Let's see how to set it up locally for a project:

1.  Create an example project and initialized with `npm`:

    ```shell
    $ mkdir example-app && cd example-app
    $ npm init --yes # defaults will be fine
    ```

1.  Install `@mockyeah/server`

    ```shell
    $ npm add --save-dev @mockyeah/server
    ```

    or

    ```shell
    $ yarn add --dev @mockyeah/server
    ```

1.  Create script file and add the source below:

    ```shell
    $ touch index.js
    ```

    ```js
    const mockyeah = require('@mockyeah/server');

    mockyeah.get('/hello-world', { text: 'Hello World' });
    ```

1.  Run the script file with Node

    ```shell
    $ node index.js
    ```

1.  Open [http://localhost:4001/hello-world](http://localhost:4001/hello-world)

1.  Profit. You should see "Hello World" returned from your mock server.

Withe relative URLs like `/hello-world` above, if no mock matches, then `mockyeah` will response with a `404`.

But `mockyeah` can accept absolute URLs like this:

- `https://localhost:4001/https://api.example.com?foo=bar`
- `https://localhost:4001/https://service.example.com/foo/bar`

This makes it easy to simply prepend the `mockyeah` server URL to your existing API URLs (see [`Connect Your App`](#connect-your-app) below).

With the [`proxy`](../../Configuration#proxy) option, `mockyeah` will also transparently forward all non-matching requests onto their original URL,
and send the response back to you.
This enables working with real APIs by default, but partially mocking responses for some requests.

So if we added this mock:

```js
mockyeah.get('https://service.example.com/foo/bar', {
  json: {
    hello: 'there'
  }
});
```

Then a request to `https://localhost:4001/https://service.example.com/foo/bar` would result in a response of
`{ "hello": "there" }`.

But any other request like `https://localhost:4001/https://api.example.com?foo=bar` would not hit any mocks so it would proxy
to the actual `https://api.example.com?foo=bar` endpoint and respond normally (though perhaps with some additional headers from `mockyeah`).

```js
const mockyeah = require('@mockyeah/server');

mockyeah.get('https://example./hello-world', { text: 'Hello World' });

fetch('https://example.local?ok=yes').then(async res => {
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log('data is now { fake: "response" }', data);
});
```

## Connect Your App

You can use [`@mockyeah/fetch`](../Packages/mockyeah-fetch) to automatically rewrite all `fetch` requests from your client-side or server-side app or unit tests
to hit your new `mockyeah` server. See the [`proxy`](../../Packages/mockyeah-fetch#proxy) option.

Or you can just manually configure your app's service URLs to point to your `mockyeah` server.

## CLI

You can use our command-line interface to start a `mockyeah` server. See more at [`@mockyeah/cli`](../Packages/mockyeah-cli).
You can also use it to record, play, or play all [suites](../../Suites) with your [`@mockyeah/server`](../../Packages/mockyeah-server).
