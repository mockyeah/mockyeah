# Getting Started in Node

To integrate `mockyeah` to mock requests within your Node or server-side app,
you can use the [`@mockyeah/fetch`](../../Packages/mockyeah-fetch) package.

This can monkeypatch or be used in place of the native `fetch` API to enable some `mockyeah` features.
This requires `fetch` API support - recommended polyfills for `fetch` for Node are `node-fetch` or `isomorhpic-fetch`.

To install:

```shell
$ npm add @mockyeah/fetch
```

Then, to set it up, simply add this code to run once when your app starts:

```js
import 'isomorhpic-fetch';
import Mockyeah from 'packages/mockyeah-fetch/dist/index';

new Mockyeah();
```

Or to add mocks programmatically:

```js
import 'isomorhpic-fetch';
import Mockyeah from '@mockyeah/fetch';

const mockyeah = new Mockyeah();

mockyeah.mock('https://example.local?ok=yes', {
  json: { fake: 'response' }
});

mockyeah.post(
  {
    url: 'https://example.local?ok=true',
    body: {
      up: 'yes'
    }
  },
  {
    json: () => ({ hello: 'there' })
  }
);

fetch('https://example.local?ok=yes').then(async res => {
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log('data is now { fake: "response" }', data);
});
```
