## Installing

`mockyeah` was built and tested with Node version 8+. Installing `mockyeah`:

```shell
# download project
$ git clone git@github.com:mockyeah/mockyeah.git
$ cd mockyeah

# install proper Node version
$ nvm install v8.16.0
$ nvm use

# install dependencies and link monorepo modules
$ npm install

# if tests pass, you're good to go
$ npm test
$ npm start
```

Open the [docs site at http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Troubleshooting

`mockyeah` is a monorepo project, the dev tool `lerna` is required to connect the sub-modules in the `./packages` directory.
If `lerna` doesn't run when you install the dependencies you can run it manually:

```shell
$ npx lerna bootstrap

# continue to run, build, and test
$ npm test
$ npm start
```
