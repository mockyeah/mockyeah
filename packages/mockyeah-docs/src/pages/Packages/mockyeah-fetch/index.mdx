# `@mockyeah/fetch`

`@mockyeah/fetch` can monkeypatch or be used in place of the native `fetch` API to enable some `mockyeah` features.
This requires `fetch` API support - recommended client-side `fetch` polyfills are `whatwg-fetch` or `isomorhpic-fetch`.

To use, simply:

```shell
$ npm add @mockyeah/fetch
```

Then:

```js
import 'isomorhpic-fetch';
import Mockyeah from '@mockyeah/fetch';

new Mockyeah();
```

Or to add mocks programmatically:

```js
import 'isomorhpic-fetch';
import Mockyeah from '@mockyeah/fetch';

const mockyeah = new Mockyeah();

mockyeah.mock('https://example.local?ok=yes', {
  json: { fake: 'response' }
});

mockyeah.post(
  {
    url: 'https://example.local?ok=true',
    body: {
      up: 'yes'
    }
  },
  {
    json: () => ({ hello: 'there' })
  }
);

fetch('https://example.local?ok=yes').then(async res => {
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log('data is now { fake: "response" }', data);
});
```

## API

See [Configuration](Configuration) for full constructor options.

The `mockyeah` object has these public properties
(see [types](https://github.com/mockyeah/mockyeah/blob/master/packages/mockyeah-fetch/src/types.ts) for more details):

```ts
{
  fetch: (url: string, fetchOptions?: {}, mockyeahFetchOptions?: MockyeahFetchOptions)
    => Promise<Response>,
  mock: (match: MatchObject, options?: ResponseOptions ) => void,
  all: (match: MatchObject, option?s: ResponseOptions ) => void,
  get: (match: MatchObject, options?: ResponseOptions ) => void,
  post: (match: MatchObject, options?: ResponseOptions ) => void,
  put: (match: MatchObject, options?: ResponseOptions ) => void,
  delete: (match: MatchObject, options?: ResponseOptions ) => void,
  options: (match: MatchObject, options?: ResponseOptions ) => void,
  patch: (match: MatchObject, options?: ResponseOptions ) => void
}
```

## Service Worker

`@mockyeah/fetch` can be configured to use a Service Worker to echo
client-side mocked requests to the Network tab in your browser's Dev Tools,
so that they appear like real requests, even though they're not hitting a server.

If your site doesn't have a Service Worker yet,
the easiest way is use the pre-configured one we offer
at `@mockyeah/fetch/dist/serviceWorker`.

If you're using Webpack, you could add another build config like:

```js
module.exports = [
  // ...other configs
  {
    entry: '@mockyeah/fetch/dist/serviceWorker',
    output: {
      filename: '__mockyeahServiceWorker.js'
    }
  }
];
```

Then configure in your app:

```js
import Mockyeah from '@mockyeah/fetch';

const mockyeah = new Mockyeah({
  serviceWorker: true
});
```

...or with overrides for defaults:

```js
import Mockyeah from '@mockyeah/fetch';

const mockyeah = new Mockyeah({
  serviceWorker: true,
  // the path where you'll be hosting the service worker:
  serviceWorkerURL: '/__mockyeahServiceWorker.js',
  // the scope of pages on your site you want it on:
  serviceWorkerScope: '/'
});
```

However, if you already have a Service Worker,
`@mockyeah/fetch` exposes functions you can integrate.
These were designed with Workbox in mind, so here's how that
might look in your custom Service Worker:

```js
import { handlerCb, matchCb } from '@mockyeah/fetch/dist/workbox';
import { registerRoute } from 'workbox-routing';

registerRoute(matchCb, handlerCb);
```

Note that with a custom Service Worker like the above
you'll have to have your own code to register it.
