# CLI

`@mockyeah/cli` provides a simple command-line interface for recording and playing suites to integrate with during development.

## Getting started

1. Install `@mockyeah/cli`

```shell
$ npm install -g @mockyeah/cli
```

or

```shell
$ yarn global add @mockyeah/cli
```

2. Configure a service call to proxy through mockyeah

To do so prepend `http://localhost:4001/` to the beginning of a service end-point in your project like so:

```
http://localhost:4001/http://example.com/your/service/url
```

We agree the above URL looks pretty nutty, but rest assured all other known approaches add unnecessary complexity.

3. Initiate a `mockyeah` suite recording

   ```shell
   $ mockyeah record my-first-suite
   ```

4. Invoke the service call you previously configured. You should see @mockyeah/cli output.

5. Stop @mockyeah/cli by hitting enter on the stop question.

6. Play back the suite

   ```shell
   $ mockyeah play my-first-suite
   ```

7. Invoke the service call again.

Good work! You've recorded and played back a suite.

## Options

```shell
$ mockyeah --help

Usage: mockyeah [options] [command]

  Commands:

    list                list suites
    play [suiteNames]   play suite(s)
    playAll             play all suites
    record [suiteName]  record suite
    start               start server
    help [cmd]          display help for [cmd]

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
```

For help with specific commands, you can pass `--help` to them, e.g.:

```shell
$ mockyeah record --help

Usage: mockyeah-record [options]

Options:
  -g, --groups [names]      record with these named groups from configuration (comma-separated and/or repeatable)
  --group [names]           alias of -g, --groups
  -o, --only [string]       only record calls to URLs containing given string (repeatable)
  -r, --only-regex [regex]  only record calls to URLs matching given regex pattern (repeatable)
  -h, --use-headers         record headers to response options

  -v, --verbose             verbose output
  -h, --help                output usage information
```

## Play

`mockyeah play [options] [suiteNames]`

Play one or more suites, passing comma-separated list of suite names, or else be prompted to pick one.

E.g., comma-separated:

```shell
$ mockyeah play some-custom-suite,some-custom-suite-2
```

or space-separated:

```shell
$ mockyeah play some-custom-suite some-custom-suite-2
```
