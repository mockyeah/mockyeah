# `@mockyeah/server`

If you haven't read [Getting Started - Server](../../Getting-Started/Server), you can start there too.

To use, simply:

```shell
$ npm add @mockyeah/server
```

Then:

```js
const mockyeah = require('@mockyeah/server');

mockyeah.get('/hello-world', { text: 'Hello World' });
```

`mockyeah` exports an instance of the [Server](mockyeah-server/API/Server) class
with local configuration or defaults.

See [Configuration](mockyeah-server/Configuration) for more info on how to configure.

To create your server programmatically, see [Server](mockyeah-server/API/Server).

The `mockyeah` instance supports the following

## HTTPS

For HTTPS support, use the `portHttps` option. By default, this uses `create-cert-files` (based on `selfsigned`, used by `webpack-dev-server`, etc.),
where it will initially auto-generate a self-signed cert within `node_modules` then continue to re-use that as long as it exists.
Alternatively, to provide your own, you can pass config options httpsKeyPath and httpsCertPath relative to `.mockyeah`/`MOCKYEAH_ROOT`.
