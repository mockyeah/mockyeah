# `watch()` API `@mockyeah/server`

Starts watch mode programmatically. See also `watch` in [Configuration](../Configuration).

Server will monitor for changes to `suitesDir` and `fixturesDir` directories, and restart automatically.
Most useful in combination with [dynamic suites](../../../Suites#dynamic-suites) or play all mode.
