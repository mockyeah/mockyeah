# `@mockyeah/server` Configuration

The default configuration may be overridden by placing a `.mockyeah` (or `.mockyeah.json`) JSON file in root of your project and adding the key/value pairs that you wish to change.
Also supports a `.mockyeah.js` as a Node module that exports a JavaScript object as the config.

## Defaults

```json
{
  "name": "mockyeah",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 4001,
  "fixturesDir": "./fixtures",
  "suitesDir": "./mockyeah",
  "output": true,
  "journal": false,
  "verbose": false,
  "proxy": true,
  "record": false,
  "latency": undefined,
  "noWebSocket": false,
  "adminServer": true,
  "adminProtocol": "http",
  "adminHost": "localhost",
  "adminPort": 4777,
  "httpsCertPath": undefined,
  "httpsKeyPath": undefined,
  "recordToFixtures": true,
  "recordToFixturesMode": "path",
  "formatScript": undefined,
  "watch": true,
  "responseHeaders": true,
  "groups": {},
  "suiteHeader": "x-mockyeah-suite",
  "suiteCookie": "mockyeahSuite",
  "aliases": [],
  "modifyRequest": undefined
}
```

## Options

### `name`

Used to identify the origin of logged output.

### `host`

Host on which `mockyeah` will run.

### `port`

Port on which `mockyeah` will run over HTTP (or use `portHttps`).

### `portHttps`

Port on which `mockyeah` will run over HTTPS (instead of `port`).

### `httpsKeyPath`

Optional file path to SSL key for custom certificates (instead of auto-generated).

### `httpsCertPath`

Optional file path to SSL key for custom certificates (instead of auto-generated).

### `fixturesDir`

Relative path to the fixtures directory.

### `suitesDir`

Relative path to the suites directory.

### `output`

Boolean to toggle `mockyeah` generated output written to `stdout`.

### `journal`

Boolean to toggle request journaling. Example journaling output:

```shell
[mockyeah][14:54:21][REQUEST][JOURNAL] {
  "callCount": 1,
  "url": "/foo?bar=baa",
  "fullUrl": "http://localhost:4001/foo?bar=baa",
  "clientIp": "127.0.0.1",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "host": "localhost:4001",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.43.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "query": {
    "bar": "baa"
  },
  "body": {}
}
```

### `verbose`

Boolean to toggle verbosity of `mockyeah` generated output.

### `start`

Whether to start the server on instantiation (otherwise use [`start()`](API/start)).

### `proxy`

Boolean to enable a proxy on startup.

The proxy will transparently forward all non-matching requests onto their original URL.

This enables working with real APIs by default but partially mocking responses for some requests.

Then you can hit your `mockyeah` server's URLs like:
`https://localhost:4001/https://api.example.com?foo=bar`
`https://localhost:4001/https://service.example.com/foo/bar`

and allow the first to pass through to the actual origin by not defining any mocks, but mock the second with:

```js
mockyeah.get('https://service.example.com/foo/bar', {
  json: {
    hello: 'there'
  }
});
```

Internally, this mounts with a leading slash, i.e., `'/https://service.example.com/foo/bar'`.

### `noWebSocket`

Boolean to disable automatic connection over WebSocket to talk to client-side `@mockyeah/fetch`.

### `record`

Boolean to enable recording on startup.

### `latency`

A default latency for all mock responses. Can override per mock.

### `watch`

Boolean to enable watch more on startup. See [`watch()`](API/watch).

### `responseHeaders`

See [@mockyeah/fetch Configuration responseHeaders](../mockyeah-fetch/Configuration#responseheaders).

### `suiteHeader`

String for the header name to use to opt-in to suites dynamically.

### `suiteCookie`

String for the cookie name to use to opt-in to suites dynamically.

### `adminServer`

Boolean to enable admin server (for recording, playing, etc.)

### `adminHost`

Host on which admin server will run.

### `adminPort`

Port on which admin server will run.

### `recordToFixtures`

Whether to record suites with response bodies written to separate files in the fixtures directory vs. inlined into the suite files.

### `recordToFixturesMode`

When `recordToFixtures` is enabled, which mode to use to refer to fixture files

- "path" (default): Use the response option of `fixture` with the path to the fixture file as a string.
- "require": For JSON fixtures, use the response option of `json` with an inline `require` of the JSON file using a relative path, otherwise fallback to "path" mode (may support custom `require`-able files in the future for users with custom setups, e.g., Webpack loaders).

#### `formatScript`

To apply custom formatting to the JS in the suite files, specify a string path to a module (relative to `mockyeah` root near your config file) that exports a function of the signature `(js: string) : string => {}`. Or if using programmatically rather than a JSON config file, you can provide a function as a value directly.

#### `aliases`

See [@mockyeah/fetch Configuration aliases](../mockyeah-fetch/Configuration#aliases).

## `modifyRequest`

See [@mockyeah/fetch Configuration modifyRequest](../mockyeah-fetch/Configuration#modifyrequest).

### `groups`

Instead of always typing out matches using `--only` or `--only-regex`, you can define them here, so that rather than:

```shell
mockyeah record --only-regex '/api/v(.*)/users' --only-regex '/api/v(.*)/posts)'
```

We can instead type:

```shell
mockyeah record --groups users,posts
```

Where we have those regexes defined in config as:

```js
{
  "groups": {
    "users": "/api/v(.*)/users",
    "posts": "/api/v(.*)/posts"
  }
}
```

## HTTPS

For HTTPS support, use the `portHttps` option. By default, this uses `create-cert-files` (based on `selfsigned`, used by `webpack-dev-server`, etc.),
where it will initially auto-generate a self-signed cert within `node_modules` then continue to re-use that as long as it exists.
Alternatively, to provide your own, you can pass config options `httpsKeyPath` and `httpsCertPath` relative to `.mockyeah`/`MOCKYEAH_ROOT`.
