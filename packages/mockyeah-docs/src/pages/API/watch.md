# `watch()`

Starts watch mode programmatically. See also `watch` in [Configuration](../../Configuration).

Server will monitor for changes to `suitesDir` and `fixturesDir` directories, and restart automatically.
Most useful in combination with [dynamic suites](../../Suites/Dynamic) or play all mode.
