There are several tools that share some goals and use cases with `mockyeah`.

You might be familiar with `nock` - it works great for mocking in
server-side or other Node apps, and in unit tests.
But it's not designed to work with client-side apps, and doesn't
provide an actual server for mocked responses.
`mockyeah` can do all of the above and more, all with the same syntax!

You might also be familiar with `Polly.JS` - like `mockyeah`, it supports both client and server-side mocking.
It's a great tool, but its design seems more oriented around
automatically recording and replaying known requests,
and to initiate recording requires configuration in app source code,
which means rebuilding or redeploying your app just to be able to record.

Here's an attempt to map out some of their features to help compare:
