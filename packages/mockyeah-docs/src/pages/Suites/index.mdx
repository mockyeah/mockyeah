# Suites

`mockyeah` provides the ability to capture request/responses and play them back later as mock services.
While recording, `mockyeah` proxies all received requests to configured hosts and captures their responses.
Suites include: response body, method, headers, status code, latency, and path.

See [`record`](../Packages/mockyeah-server/API/record), [`recordStop`](../Packages/mockyeah-server/API/recordStop), and [`play`](../Packages/mockyeah-server/API/play).

See also our section on the [CLI](../Packages/mockyeah-cli)
for another way to record and play.

## Ad Hoc Suites

Suites can be created manually. This can ease the repetitive setup of multiple
services. Here are the steps to creating ad hoc suites:

1. Create a suite directory (e.g. `./mockyeah/suite-example`)

2. Add one or more files containing, at minimum, the following:

```js
module.exports = [
  [
    '/some/service',
    {
      text: 'Hello world!'
    }
  ]
];
```

3. Play your ad hoc suites.

```js
require('@mockyeah/server').play('suite-example');
```

Or play all:

```js
require('@mockyeah/server').playAll();
```

That's it!

## Dynamic Suites

Without mounting suites explicitly via `play` or `playAll`, you can dynamically opt-in to them
using our custom HTTP header `x-mockyeah-suite`, or custom cookie `mockyeahSuite`,
with a value equal to the name of a suite in `suitesDir` from [configuration](../Packages/mockyeah-server/Configuration).
