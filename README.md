# Mock Yeah [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ryanricard/mockyeah.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ryanricard/mockyeah)

__"An invaluable service mocking platform built on Express."__

Testing is difficult when you don't have control of your data. This project puts you in complete control, enabling you to implement __real mock web services__ with ease. Real mock services means you have control of response payloads, HTTP Status Codes, response latency, and more.

Have a requirement to implement specific behavior when a service is slow to respond or a server returns an unexpected status code? No problem! This platform makes developing for such requirements easy.

## Install
```shell
$ npm install mockyeah --save-dev
```

## Usage

### Introductory tutorial
1. Create an example project and initialized with NPM
  ```shell
  $ mkdir example-app && cd example-app
  $ npm init # all defaults will be fine
  ```

1. Install `mockyeah`
  ```shell
  $ npm install mockyeah --save-dev
  ```

1. Create script file and add the source below
  ```shell
  $ touch index.js
  ```
  ```js
  const mockyeah = require('mockyeah');

  mockyeah.get('/hello-world', { text: 'Hello World' });
  ```

1. Run the script file with Node
  ```shell
  $ node index.js
  ```

1. Open [http://localhost:4001/hello-world](http://localhost:4001/hello-world)

1. Profit. You should see "Hello World" returned from your mock server.

### Testing example
```js
const request = require('supertest')('http://localhost:4041');
const mockyeah = require('mockyeah');

describe('Wondrous service', () => {
  // remove service mocks after each test
  afterEach(() => mockyeah.reset());

  it('should create a mock service that returns an internal error', (done) => {
    // create failing service mock
    mockyeah.get('/wondrous', { status: 500 });

    // assert service mock is working
    request
      .get('/wondrous')
      .expect(500, done);
  });

  it('should create a mock service that returns JSON', (done) => {
    // create service mock that returns json data
    mockyeah.get('/wondrous', { json: { foo: 'bar' } });

    // assert service mock is working
    request
      .get('/wondrous')
      .expect(200, { foo: 'bar' }, done);
  });
});
```

## Package Dependencies
- Mock Yeah was built and tested with Node v4.2.3
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

## API

### Mock Service Creation API
__mockyeah.get(path, options)__<br/>
__mockyeah.put(path, options)__<br/>
__mockyeah.post(path, options)__<br/>
__mockyeah.delete(path, options__<br/>

Each of the methods above create a mock service with a HTTP verb matching its
respective method name.

#### Arguments

##### Path
Path to which to respond. Fully supports all Express path matching
options.

##### Options
Response options informing Mock Yeah how to respond to matching requests. Supported options:
- filePath (String; optional) - File with contents to include in response body. Assumes response Content-Type of file type.
- fixture (String; optional) - Fixture file with contents to include in response body. Assumes response Content-Type of file type. Default fixture file location is `./mockyeah/fixtures` in your project.
- headers (Object; optional) - Header key value pairs to include in response.
- html (String; optional) - HTML to include in response body. Assumes response Content-Type of `text/html`.
- json (Object; optional) - JSON to include in response body. Assumes response Content-Type of `application/json`.
- latency (Number/Milliseconds; optional) - Used to control the response timing of a response.
- raw (String; optional) - Text to include in response body. Content-Type is the default Express type if not specified in header.
- text (String; optional) - Text to include in response body. Assumes response Content-Type of `text/plain`.
- type (String; optional) - Content-Type HTTP header to return with response. Proxies option to Express response method `res.type(type)`; more info here: http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.type
- status (String; optional; default: 200) - HTTP response status code.

Note, only one of the following is permitted per service: filePath, fixture, html, json, or text.

### Mock Service Management Methods

#### mockyeah.reset()
Resets all existing mock services. Useful on test teardown.

#### mockyeah.close()
Shuts down the Mock Yeah Express server. Useful if running Mock Yeah with a file
watcher. Mock Yeah attempts to start a new instance of Express each test
iteration. After all tests run, `mockyeah.close()` should be called to shutdown
Mock Yeah's Express server. Failing to do so will result in `EADDRINUSE`
exceptions. This is due to Mock Yeah attempting to start a server on a port
occupied by a server it started previously.
