**A powerful service mocking, recording, and playback utility.**

Testing is difficult when you don't have control of your data. mockyeah puts you in complete control, eabling you to implement **real mock web services** with ease. Real mock services means you have control of response payloads, HTTP Status Codes, response latency, and more.

Have a requirement to implement specific behavior when a service is slow to respond or a server returns an unexpected status code? No problem! mockyeah makes developing for such requirements easy.

## Install

```shell
$ npm install mockyeah --save-dev
```

```
