Recorded responses\nare written to ./mockyeah. To use this feature, you must update\nthe service addresses in your application to proxy through mockyeah. Here is an\nexample of an address configured for recording:\nhttp://localhost:[mockyeah port]/http://example.com/your/service/url\nThe above URL looks pretty crazy, but rest assured it works and eliminates the need for a system level proxy.\nmockyeah.play([snapshot name])\nsnapshot name (String; required) Directory name from which to mount contained\nservice snapshots (i.e. ./mockyeah/[snapshot name]).\nMounts each service snapshot. Each snapshot will be mounted with the\nexact same payload, headers, status, and latency as captured during its recording.\nThis behavior may be changed by altering the values in the snapshot files.\nHere is an example of a service snapshot file:\n{\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\n  \"url\": \"http://example.com/some/service\",\n  \"path\": \"/some/service\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"x-powered-by\": \"Express\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/plain; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"content-length\": \"12\",\n      \"etag\": \"W/\\\"5-iwTV43ddKY54RV78XKQE1Q\\\"\",\n      \"date\": \"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 06:17:49 GMT\",\n      \"connection\": \"close\"\n    },\n    \"status\": 200,\n    \"raw\": \"Hello world!\",\n    \"latency\": 57\n  }\n}\n\nAd hoc snapshots\nSnapshots can be created manually. This can ease the repetitive setup of multiple\nservices. Here are the steps to creating ad hoc snapshots:\n\nCreate a snapshot directory (e.g. ./mockyeah/snapshot-example)\nAdd one or more JSON files containing, at minimum, the following properties:\n\n{\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\n  \"path\": \"/some/service\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"text\": \"Hello world!\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nPlay your ad hoc snapshots.\n\nrequire('mockyeah').play('snapshot-example');\n\n\nThat's it!\n\n"},"pages/Service-Snapshot-CLI.html":{"url":"pages/Service-Snapshot-CLI.html","title":"Service Snapshot CLI","keywords":"","body":"Service Snapshot CLI\nmockyeah-cli provides a simple command line interface for easily capturing and mounting service snapshots to integrate with during development.\nGetting started\n1. Install mockyeah-cli\n$ npm install -g mockyeah-cli\n\n2.
